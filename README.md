# STEREO-RECONSTRUCTION
Stereo reconstruction is a method by which we obtain the depth of points in a particular scene by using a pair of stereo image.
## what are stereo images:
pair images of same scene which are taken from a different angle or perspective
## basic principal involved
- epipolar geomerty:

epipolar geomerty gives us a geometric relation between pair of setreo images from which depth of a point can be calculated.
This geometric relation is known as epipolar constraint
according to epipolar contraint a particualr point in firstrimages lies on the line of intersection of image  plane of the second image and palne containing optical centres of stereo cameras and point in real world.

epipolar geomerty converts 2D search into 1D search for stereo correspondance.
